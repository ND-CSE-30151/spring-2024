        "What is a computer? Most of you are juniors in computer science, and by the end of this year, we hope you'll understand, from bottom to top, how a C/C++/Python program running on Linux running on x86/ARM/MIPS works. But we want your computer science degree to be good for a lifetime. In 50 years, what kinds of computers will you be programming, building, or even inventing? In this course, we want to teach you what we believe to be true, not just about a particular kind of computer, but about all computers, past, present, and future.\n",
        "\n",
        "To do this, we need to look to the beginning. Historically, the answer to this question came from a totally different direction, from people asking not \"what is a computer,\" but \"what does it mean to compute?\" For in 1936, everyone knew what a computer was. A printer is a person who prints; a dishwasher is a person who washes dishes; and a computer is a person who computes. For example, when you do arithmetic or solve a system of linear equations or find a derivative, you're computing -- you're following an algorithm that you learned in school. But some math requires more ingenuity, like writing proofs. In the early 20th century, mathematicians were starting to wonder whether there was an \"effective procedure\" (we would say, an algorithm) for writing proofs too.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 1936, Turing published [the paper](https://doi.org/10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230) that many consider to be the founding document of computer science. His answer to the question about what was meant by an \"effective procedure\" was not the first, but it was the most convincing. He imagined a computing person with access to an unlimited supply of paper, argued convincingly for various simplifying assumptions about how he/she computes, and finally imagined a machine (which he called an a-machine, but which we now call a **Turing machine**) that would do the same thing automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although Turing machines were invented just as a mathematical construct, they are important for computer science because all current computers (under some reasonable assumptions) can be emulated by a Turing machine. We will further argue that even computers of the future can be emulated by Turing machines. If you accept these arguments, then Turing machines serve as our definition of what a computer is: if something can be done on a computer, it can be done on a Turing machine; if something cannot be done on a Turing machine, it cannot be done on any other computer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we get there in Unit III, we will study several simpler models of computation in Units I and II. You're probably familiar with two of them already: **deterministic finite automata** (also known as finite state machines) and **regular expressions**. And in Unit IV, we will continue to study Turing machines, but we'll restrict them to use only **polynomial time**."

        "\n",
        "The second ingredient is that we need a way of talking about computational problems. It would seem that there are so many different kinds of things that computers do, that we have to study each kind separately. But maybe we can reduce them all to one kind of problem, and focus our study on that one kind of problem. Namely, we want to treat every kind of object as a **string of symbols** (e.g., bits), and we want to treat every kind of computational problem as a **yes/no question about strings**.\n",
        "\n",
        "People are fairly comfortable these days with the idea that any kind of object we might want to compute about can be represented as a string. We deal every day with messages, music, pictures, movies, books, etc., in digital form, with the awareness that these are just strings of 0’s and 1’s.\n",
        "\n",
        "Less obvious, perhaps, is that it makes sense to reduce all kinds of computations down to yes/no questions about strings. There are a number of objections that could be raised and which we can discuss in class, but perhaps the most glaring one is that the output from a computer program is much more than just a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer. For example, suppose we want a program that looks at a chess board `b` and outputs the best next move -- that's not a yes/no question. But suppose further that we can write a function `is_best_move` that takes a chess board, a possible next move `m`, and returns \"yes\" if `m` is the best move and \"no\" otherwise. Then we can write a function\n",

        "                return m\n",
        "\n",
        "Since it's possible to implement any function as a wrapper around a function that returns yes/no, it's sufficient, for pretty much the rest of the course, to only think about computations that result in a yes/no answer. (Caveat: Implementing a function this way can be *much slower* than implementing it directly, but for the first three units of the course, we don't care about efficiency. In Unit IV, we will talk about how to improve the efficiency of this trick.)"
